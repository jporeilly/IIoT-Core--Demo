## <font color='red'>Workshop - Deploy Hello World Application</font>

This is an optional workshop to outline the process of deploying and deploying an application to the Hitachi Vantara Foundry Platform.

Foundry provides an App custom resource that you can use to create links in the Foundry control plane UI. By including this resource in your solution's helm chart, you can create links to resources both inside and outside of the Kubernetes cluster.

This guide walks you through the major steps of integrating and deploying a Kubernetes-based application as a Foundry solution.

As a solution, applications benefit from Foundry standardized deployment, centralized authn/authz/sso, integrated log aggregration, automated network routing, secured service-to-service communication, namespaced multi-tenancy, portability, simplified administration, and much more.

* Extend a helm chart to create a Foundry solution
* Integrate with control-plane services by adding Foundry custom resources
* Deploy the solution to a Kubernetes cluster using the Foundry control-plane

<em>Tagging Images</em>

Ensure that your solution images are portable to various environments by tagging them with the registry_name string. 

All images that you include in your solution must have this naming format:

``registry_name/<repository-name>:<image-tag>``

In this format, registry_name is a literal string. For example:

registry_name/foundry-hello-world:1.0

The control plane requires this naming format so that it can store images in a customer-provided or embedded image registry, the name of which is not known until control plane runtime. At Foundry control plane deployment, the registry_name string is replaced with the name of the registry that the control plane has been configured to use.

These specially-formatted image names must be specified in these places:

* In your solution helm chart's values.yaml file. Note that during an update, only unmodified values in a chart will be updated. If your image changes, the keys that include "registry_name" will be seen as "modified" and will not be updated, so use separate variables for the "tag". The default chart generated by helm create should be fine.

* On the images themselves that you provide to the Forge tool for packaging.

  > You need to use the docker tag command to replace the existing registry name with ``registry_name``. If the image name does not include a registry name, you need to prepend the image name with the registry_name string.

  > When you run docker save to save the image as a tar, you need to include the registry_name string. For example:

``docker save registry_name/foundry-hello-world:1.0 -o foundry-hello-world-1.0.tar``

At runtime, the control-plane replaces the registry_name string with the name of the specific registry that the control plane has been configured to use.

Example: Tagging an existing local image with registry_name

``docker tag foundry-hello-world:1.0 registry_name/foundry-hello-world:1.0``
